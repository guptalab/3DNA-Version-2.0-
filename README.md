3DNA README
========================================================

-Software repository for the tool 3DNA: A Tool for DNA Modelling.

-This software can be used to model/design/visualize complex 3 Dimensional shapes with nano meter level precision using single stranded DNA bricks.

-This software is developed by [`Shikhar Gupta`](www.guptalab.org/shikhargupta) and [`Foram Joshi`](www.guptalab.org/foramj) at Laboratory of Natural Information Processing, DA-IICT (Gupta Lab). It has been presented as a poster at [FNANO'14](http://www.cs.duke.edu/FNANO/).

Build Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------

**a) For MAC/Linux :-** 

- Download the source code(as .zip) from git or clone it using following command :-

        git clone https://github.com/gshikhri/3DNA.git

- Open terminal and move to the 3DNA directory.

- You might have to install Java3D library on your Linux system, for this:
        
        sudo apt-get install libjava3d-java

- Once Java3D is installed in the system, you can compile the code using make utility

        make: to compile the code
        make run: to execute the binary
        make jar: to create a runnable jar file

**b) For Windows :-**

- Download the command line tools for git hub and clone this repository.

        git clone https://github.com/gshikhri/3DNA.git

- Install Java3D library files from its official [website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-138252.html).

- We recommend using [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as an IDE, for compiling 3DNA on your system. 

- Hope that helps you to install 3DNA. In case any shout out @ `3dna@guptalab.org`
